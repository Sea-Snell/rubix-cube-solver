# rubix-cube-solver

This is a bi-directional bredeth first search algorithm that can solve both the 2x2x2 rubix cube and the 3x3x3 rubix cube.

please note that the computer is unable to solve 3x3x3 cube is a reasonable amount of time.

For a faster implementation check out my nural network rubix cube solver, which is a work in progress.
